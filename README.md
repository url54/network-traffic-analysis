# Network Traffic Analysis Projects

__Objective Statement__
The objective of this repository is to build and maintain a portfolio of network forensic case studies, with each analysis documenting a unique security incident. Leveraging a standardized methodology with tools such as Wireshark, Zeek, and Suricata, each case study will deconstruct a provided PCAP file to reconstruct the full attack timeline, from initial compromise to final exfiltration. By mapping adversary actions to the MITRE ATT&CK framework and producing actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs) for each scenario, this collection serves to demonstrate a broad and continuously developing competency in network-based incident response.
